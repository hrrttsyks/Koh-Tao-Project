            <h2>Why Koh Tao?</h2>
            <h3>Koh Tao, Turtle Island</h3>
            <p>
              Koh Tao, “The Turtle Island,” is a small paradise island isolated
              in the Gulf of Thailand. It is east of the Surat Thani coastline,
              with two neighbouring islands, Koh Phangan and Koh Samui. Koh Tao
              is officially a subdistrict of Surat Thani province, Thailand, and
              the name in English means “turtle island” for the island’s
              connection with its being inhabited by sea turtles. Though they
              are not as plentiful as in the past, nowadays, you can still find
              green turtles and hawksbill turtles in some areas, such as Shark
              Bay. The island’s shape is also thought to resemble a turtle when
              viewed from Koh Phangan.
            </p>
            <p>
              The island’s natural beauty, both above and below the water, with
              its stunning coral reefs and abundant marine life in clear, warm
              water, brings thousands of visitors each year, making it an
              unforgettable destination for divers, adventurers and travellers
              alike. This, combined with the relaxed atmosphere and lifestyle,
              has attracted people here for over 50 years and is now a warm
              second home for many. Koh Tao has developed in many ways, and with
              its thriving diving industry, it is now one of the leading centres
              for dive education in the world.
